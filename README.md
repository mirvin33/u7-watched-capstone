## Background
In today’s entertainment landscape, viewers often struggle to keep track of the plethora of TV shows and movies
available across various streaming platforms. With a growing number of services like Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime,
Disney+, and so many others, users frequently find themselves overwhelmed by the abundance of content. Additionally,
managing watchlists within individual streaming platforms can be cumbersome, as users typically subscribe to multiple
services, each with their own watchlist functionality.

## Problem
Despite the convenience of digital streaming, users face several challenges in managing and tracking the content they
want to watch:
1.	Fragmented Information: Users need to switch between different platforms to manage individual watchlist, leading
      to fragmented information and lack of centralized control.
2. Centralized Watchlist Management:  Users cannot easily create a comprehensive watchlist encompassing multiple
   streaming platforms, which leads to confusion about what they have or have not watched.
3. Inability to track Progress: Users find it challenging to track their progress in watching TV shows and movies,
   causing them to forget which shows they have completed.

## Objective
The objective of the Watched website is to create a user-friendly platform where users can manage and track their TV
shows and movies from multiple streaming services in one place. The website aims to provide a seamless experience for
adding, organizing, and updating watchlist, allowing users to mark content as “Watched” once completed.

## Key Features
-	Centralized Watchlist: Users can add titles to a unified watchlist, along with the streaming service where the
     content is available.
-	Provides users with a comprehensive view of their content options.
-	Progress Tracking: Users can mark titles as “Watched”, allowing them to keep track of the completed shows or
     movies.
-	Search List: As some users may have a long list, they can search their list to find a particular title or streaming
     service.
-	User-Friendly Interface: A clean, intuitive interface ensures that users can easily navigate the website and manage
     their website and manage their watchlist.

By addressing these challenges, “Watched” aims to simplify the user streaming experience, making it easier to enjoy
their favorite shows and movies without the hassle of managing multiple watchlist across different platforms.
